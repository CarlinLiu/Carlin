                <p>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?
                  I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and
                  I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have
                  over 300 confirmed kills.
                </p>
                <p>I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire
                  US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will
                  wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been
                  seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.

          <p>You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet?
            Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies
            across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare
            for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing
            you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime,
            and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare
            hands.
